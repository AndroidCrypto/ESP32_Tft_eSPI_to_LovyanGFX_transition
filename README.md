# ESP32_Tft_eSPI_to_LovyanGFX_transition
The TFT_eSPI is the de-facto-standard when using TFT displays connected to a microcontroller of the ESP32 family. Unfortunately this library looks like abandoned as errors were not fixed by the author since many months. It might be a good idea to transist your project to LovyanGFX library.
